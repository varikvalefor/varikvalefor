\section{Executive Summary}
A curt response is written because the question requests information which is easily accessible via a dictionary or manual page.

\section{Definitions}
Let $q$ denote the question which receives a curt response.

\section{Some Proofs}
\begin{thm}
        VARIK curtly responds to $q$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
        ${}$

        $q$ is a stupid question.

        For all stupid questions $g$, VARIK responds to $g$ only if VARIK curtly responds to $g$.

        VARIK responds to $g$.

        Therefore, VARIK curtly responds to $g$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
        $q$ is a stupid question.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
        For all questions $g$, $g$ is a stupid question if $g$ requests information which is easily accessible via a dictionary or manual.

        $q$ requests information which is easily accessible via a dictionary or manual.

        Therefore, $q$ is a stupid question.
\end{proof}
